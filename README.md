# glitch-synchronizer

Automatically synchronize Glitch projects to GitHub using GitHub Actions.

A [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps) is created to let GitHub Actions access other repos (normally GitHub Actions can only access its own repo).
